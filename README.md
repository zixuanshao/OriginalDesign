Original Design
===============

This assignment is similar to the previous assignment. Start by logging into GitHub and forking and cloning this repository:  

https://github.com/LowellSampleClass/OriginalDesign  

Now, modify the Java code in the `OriginalDesign.pde` file to create your own design using the Processing graphics functions. Your program should use a variety of the Processing graphics functions. You will also
define four functions:  
`void setup()`  
`void draw()`  
and at least two of your own 

You will also need to modify `index.html` to personalize the title, header and footer. Have fun and be creative! Your design doesn't have to look like anyone else's.
